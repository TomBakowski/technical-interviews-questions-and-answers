     # Data Types in JavaScript

## Overview

- **Categories**: JavaScript data types are divided into primitive types and object types.
- **Behavior and Nature**: These categories define how values are stored and manipulated in variables.

## Primitive Types

- **Characteristics**: Immutable (unchangeable) and compared by value.
- **Types**:
  - **Number**: Integer and floating-point numbers (e.g., 25, 80.5).
  - **String**: Textual data ('Hello, world!').
  - **Boolean**: Logical values, true or false.
  - **Undefined**: Unassigned variable (e.g., `let x;`).
  - **Null**: Intentional absence of object value, often false in boolean contexts.
  - **Symbol (ES6)**: Unique and immutable identifier for object properties.
  - **BigInt (ES2020)**: Large whole numbers exceeding 2^53 - 1.

## Object Types

- **Characteristics**: Collections of data, mutable, and stored by reference.
- **Types**:
  - **Object**: Key-value pairs (e.g., `{ name: "Alice", age: 25 }`).
  - **Array**: Collection of different types (e.g., `[1, 'two', true]`).
  - **Function**: Executable code blocks, treated as first-class objects.
  - **Date, RegExp, etc.**: Built-in objects for dates, regular expressions, etc.

## Differences and Characteristics

- **Storage**:
  - **Primitive Types**: Stored by value.
  - **Object Types**: Stored by reference.
- **Mutability**:
  - **Primitive Types**: Immutable.
  - **Object Types**: Mutable.
- **Comparison**:
  - **Primitive Types**: Compared by value.
  - **Object Types**: Compared by reference.

## Importance

- **Effective Programming**: Understanding these types is key for manipulating and comparing values in JavaScript.
