     # Comparison Operators in JavaScript: `==` vs `===`

## Overview

- **Purpose**: Both `==` and `===` are used for comparison, but they differ in handling type coercion and type checking.

## `==` (Loose Equality or Abstract Equality)

- **Type Coercion**: Converts values to the same type before comparison.
- **Use Case**: Useful when checking equality regardless of value type (e.g., `0 == '0'` evaluates to `true`).
- **Potential Issues**: Can lead to unexpected results due to non-intuitive coercion rules (e.g., `null == undefined` is `true`, but `null == 0` is `false`).

## `===` (Strict Equality or Identity)

- **No Type Coercion**: Checks both value and type, without converting types.
- **Use Case**: Recommended for most comparisons to avoid unintended results.
- **Best Practice**: Favored in style guides and linters for clarity and reliability.

## Example Comparisons

- `0 == false` → `true` (0 coerced to false)
- `0 === false` → `false` (different types: number vs boolean)
- `2 == '2'` → `true` (string '2' coerced to number)
- `2 === '2'` → `false` (different types: number vs string)
- `null == undefined` → `true` (special coercion rule)
- `null === undefined` → `false` (different types)

## Key Takeaways

- **Crucial Understanding**: Knowing the difference between `==` and `===` is essential to avoid unintended behavior.
- **General Rule**: Prefer `===` (strict equality) for its predictability and clarity.
