     # Prototype Chain in JavaScript

## Basics of Prototype

- **Prototype Property**: Each JavaScript object has a property called `prototype`. This references another object with shared properties and methods.
- **Inheritance from Prototype**: Objects created from a constructor function inherit properties and methods from their prototype.

## Chain Formation

- **Accessing Properties/Methods**: JavaScript first checks an object's own properties.
- **Prototype Chain Lookup**: If not found, it checks the prototype's properties/methods, continuing up the chain until found or reaching `Object.prototype`.

## Prototype-based Inheritance

- **Inheritance Mechanism**: Objects inherit from other objects through the prototype link, contrasting with class-based inheritance in languages like Java or C++.

## Example

```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function () {
  return `Hello, my name is ${this.name}`;
};

const john = new Person('John');
john.greet(); // "Hello, my name is John"
```

- **Inheritance in Action**: `john` inherits the `greet` method from `Person.prototype`.
- **Prototype Link**: `john.__proto__` points to `Person.prototype`.

## End of Chain - Object.prototype

- **Ultimate Prototype**: The chain ends with `Object.prototype`, the root prototype.
- **Inherited Methods**: Methods like `hasOwnProperty` in `Object.prototype` are available to all objects.

## Conclusion

- **Importance**: Understanding the prototype chain is key to mastering object behavior in JavaScript, including method inheritance and "class" creation pre-ES6 class syntax.
